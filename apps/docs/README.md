# Open Agent Platform Docs

The OAP docs are built with Mintlify. To preview the docs locally, run the following command:

```bash
npx mintlify dev
```

Or install mint globally:

```bash
npm i -g mintlify
mintlify dev
```

This will start a local development server at http://localhost:3000. You can now view and edit your docs in real-time.

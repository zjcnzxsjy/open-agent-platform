# Open Agent Platform

Open Agent Platform is a no-code agent building platform. These agents can be connected to a wide range of tools, RAG servers, and even other agents through an Agent Supervisor!

## Overview

Open Agent Platform provides a modern, web-based interface for creating, managing, and interacting with LangGraph agents. It's designed with simplicity in mind, making it accessible to users without technical expertise, while still offering advanced capabilities for developers.

## Key Features

- **Agent Management**: Build, configure, and interact with agents through an intuitive interface.
- **RAG Integration**: First-class support for Retrieval Augmented Generation with [LangConnect](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langconnect).
- **MCP Tools**: Connect your agents to external tools through MCP servers.
- **Agent Supervision**: Orchestrate multiple agents working together through an Agent Supervisor.
- **Authentication**: Built-in authentication and access control.
- **Configurable Agents**: Easily define how users can configure your agents through a rich UI.

# Concepts/FAQ

## Concepts

### Agents

An agent is a custom configuration on-top of an existing LangGraph graph. This is the same concept as an `assistant`, in the LangGraph API.

## FAQ

### Do I need a backend server?

OAP does not require a standalone backend server to be running in order for the web app to work. As long as you've added deployments from LangGraph Platform to your instance, it should work as expected!

However, if you want to use the RAG features, you will need to have the LangConnect server running on its own. This is because the LangConnect RAG server is intended to be hosted independently from your LangGraph deployments. See the [LangConnect docs](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langconnect/blob/main/README.md) for more information.

### How can I build my own agents?

Yes! See the [Building Your Own Agents](#building-your-own-agents) section for more information.

### How can I use non-supabase auth?

Yes! It requires some modifications to be made to the code, but we've implemented authentication in a way which makes it easy to swap out with any other authentication provider. 

### How can I use non-langgraph agents?

No. All agents you intend to use with OAP must be LangGraph agents, deployed on LangGraph Platform.

### Why is my agent's config is only showing string inputs, and not custom fields?

First, ensure you're using the latest version of LangGraph. If running locally, make sure you're using the latest version of the LangGraph API, and CLI packages. If deploying, make sure you've published a revision after 05/14/2025. Then, check that you have the `x_oap_ui_config` metadata set on your configurable fields. If you have, check that your configurable object is defined using LangGraph Zod (if using TypeScript), as this is required for the Open Agent Platform to recognize & render your UI fields.

If it's still not working, confirm your `x_oap_ui_config` metadata has the proper fields set.
